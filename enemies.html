        <p class="p">Our main enemy is iggy. He started being our arch arch-nemesis in 28th Feb 2018. He is Known as CHICKEN CLANS most
            wanted bankrupt criminal. We want to stop his behaviour at once. Our other enemies are
            <a href=""></a><a href="pogavich.html">Pogavich</a>.At the moment we are not too focused on them but once we have stopped he who must not be
            mentioned we will then start attacking Sportavillians. Our enemies are not people we don't like they are people
            who are trying to atack LORD CHICKEN. CHICKEN CLAN has many other enemies but at the momment we are focusing
            on
            <a href="iggy.html">iggy</a> (sorry I mean he who must not be mentioned). We are focusing on he who must not be mentioned because
            he is the current person annoying us at the moment. He is annoying us because he wants us to play with himself
            more than LORD CHICKEN. Our other enemie is Oscar because he is on he who must not be mentioned's team. Oscar
            is loyal to he who must not be metioned because he is his master. Whatever he says Oscar will do it. I have to
            admit Oscar is strong. He who must not be mentioned has also got a `bodyguard` called Aaron because he who must
            not be mentioned is in Sportavillians Aaron has sighned up to be he who must not be mentioned's bodyguard. You
            have to watch out because at any moment he who must not be mentioned might secretly jump on you
            and you might hurt yourself.
